**Note**: I have personally tested all of the programs on my laptop; no permanent damage was caused by any of them. But I cannot guarantee your safety. So **run them on your own risk**. 

You can stop them by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+Del* or kill the process with task manager. For testing, you may also use online compilers, like- [TutorialsPoint-CodingGround](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm) or [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages).
